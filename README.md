# Advanced Seminar Operations & Supply Chain Management (WIB22964): Logistics and Supply Chain Management
 ============================================================================================
 ECML_PKDD_TaxiTrajectoryPrediction
As part of the Advanced Seminar Class at the Technical University of Munich, I was assigned to perform data analysis on a former Kaggle competition on prediction taxi trajectories.

 ## Project Details
 **Description**: 
 ## Environment
The project was developed with Python 3.9. We used Pycharm as our IDE as well as used JupyterLab to run our notebooks. It is possible to run the notebooks also on Jupyter Notebook. We also create a scenario in Vadere as part of the bonus question in Task 4. 
 ## How to test the software
Each task has its own separate folder structure with the relevant JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook and python scripts.
